/**
 * Trait class for ContentType search.
 *
 * This is a breakout of the old Bolt\Content class and serves two main purposes:
 *   * Maintain backward compatibility for Bolt\Content through the remainder of
 *     the 2.x development/release life-cycle
 *   * Attempt to break up former functionality into sections of code that more
 *     resembles Single Responsibility Principles
 *
 * These traits should be considered transitional, the functionality in the
 * process of refactor, and not representative of a valid approach.
